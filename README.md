# Computer Algebra System

This is an early schematic for a Computer Algebra System in the Lean 4 programming language. Based on a previous project implemented in Python. 

Currently, only has a lexer, parser, and a sketch of an algorithm for constructing a tree out of a given expression.

Ultimately will include evaluation and verified properties along the way.
